Andorid-Lab-1
=============

Basic UI Elements, ListViews, ListAdapters ... 
In this lab, we will be exploring the basic UI elements (ImageView, TextView, Button) incorporated in a ListView. ListViews are views that handle displaying multiple items of the same layout.  A single item's layout is composed of smaller basic UI elements. ListAdapters hold the data for each item and feeds the content to the ListView. <br>Checkout [ListViews](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html) and [ArrayAdapters](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html).
